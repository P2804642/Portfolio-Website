      <h4> About Me:</h4>
      <p> Hi My name is Nathan Raynor and I am a freelance photographer, videographer and video editor. I am currently doing a degree in media production at De Montfort University in Leicester which is only helping further my skills
        and increase the quality of my work to an industry standard. While I do work in photography, my specialty is most definitely videography, more specifically cinematography and camera work on productions of short films. I have a keen interest
        and deep passion for media production which always lead to me striving for my work to be the absolute best work it can be. 
      </p>

    <!-- this line of css was left here as an issue kept persisting with the position value between the home and gallery pages having the footer in different positions, despite trying to alter the code in the stylesheet the only way i could get them both in the right position was by overriding the stylesheet commands for the home page-->
